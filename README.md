The goal of this repo is to exploit unsupervised leaning to find fraud (anomaly) in the financial datasets. There are four file with different objectives as follows:

1- Evaluation of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods:  
Objective:  
• To evaluate the performance of various unsupervised anomaly detection methods across
multiple datasets.   
• To vary the outlier percentage in each dataset to observe its effect on the performance of
the models.  

2- Anomaly Detection in Finance Dataset (Credit Card Fraud):  
Objective:  
• Building and Analyzing a Finance Dataset for Anomaly Detection.  
• Engineering and Evaluation of an Anomaly Detection Pipeline  

3- Explainability of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Models:  
Objective:   
• To investigate methods for explaining and visualizing the results of unsupervised anomaly
detection models, specifically LOF, KNN, and IForest.  
• To apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to these models to understand how feature
contributions affect anomaly scores.  
• To compare the feature importance and decision-making processes of the different anomaly
detection models.  

4- Impact of Feature Selection on ROC-AUC and Training Time in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Using SHAP Values  
Objective:   
• Understanding the impact of feature selection on the performance and efficiency of the anomaly detection models.
