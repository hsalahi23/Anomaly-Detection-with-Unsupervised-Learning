# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Financial Data: Evaluation, Explainability, and Feature Optimization

The goal of this repository is to leverage unsupervised learning techniques to detect fraud (anomalies) in financial datasets. The repository is organized into four files, each with specific objectives:

1- Evaluation of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Methods:  
Objective:  
• Evaluate the performance of various unsupervised anomaly detection methods across multiple datasets.  
• Analyze the impact of varying the outlier percentage in each dataset on model performance.  

2- Anomaly Detection in Finance Dataset (Credit Card Fraud):  
Objective:  
• Build and analyze a financial dataset focused on anomaly detection.  
• Develop and evaluate a comprehensive anomaly detection pipeline.  

3- Explainability of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Models:  
Objective:   
• Investigate methods for explaining and visualizing the outcomes of unsupervised anomaly detection models, specifically LOF, KNN, and IForest.  
• Apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to these models to understand how feature contributions influence anomaly scores.  
• Compare the feature importance and decision-making processes across different anomaly detection models.  

4- Impact of Feature Selection on ROC-AUC and Training Time in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Using SHAP Values  
Objective:   
• Explore the impact of feature selection on the performance and efficiency of anomaly detection models.  
• Assess how SHAP values can guide feature selection to optimize ROC-AUC and reduce training time.
